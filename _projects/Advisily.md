The source code can be viewed in my [github repo](https://github.com/Youssef-Agiza/Advisily).

Advisily is an automated web advisor that is used by the computer science and engineering department in the [American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu) to advise students about their courses. I built using Node.Js and MySQL for the backend and ReactJs for the frontend.

    </div>

The users are prompted some questions regarding thier major and the website gives them an academic plan for the upcoming semesters.
