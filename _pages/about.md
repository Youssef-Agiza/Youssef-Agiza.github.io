I am tech enthusiast who loves exploring new fields and learning new technical(and non-technical) skills. I am a software engineer who aims to build high quality, highly-maintainable softwares.
Currently, I am undergraduate student in the [American University in Cairo(AUC)](https://www.aucegypt.edu) pursusing a B.Sc degree in Computer Science.

I have experience in using C/C++ and applying OOP programming concepts. I also have knowledge in machine learning and programming in python. I've built and maintained both web and mobile applications using ReactJs, React Native, and Node.JS. For more information, take a look at [my projects]({{page.project_url}}) or [resume]({{page.resume_url}})
